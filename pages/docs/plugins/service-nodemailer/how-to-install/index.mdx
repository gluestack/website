# How to Install

##

<br/>

* To add Nodemailer into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:
  ```sh
  $ node glue add service-nodemailer <instance-name>
  ```
  <br/>

* For instance, let's install an instance named **nodemailer** in our gluestack project:
  ```sh
  $ node glue add service-nodemailer nodemailer
  ```

  <br/>
* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**services**” and inside that **services** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **nodemailer** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path should be something like this:
    
   ```jsx
      📂backend
      ┗ 📂services
          ┗ 📂nodemailer
    ```
