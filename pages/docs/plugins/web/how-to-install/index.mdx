# How to Install

##

To add frontend into your gluestack project, you can run the following command in project's root directory:
```sh
$ node glue add web <instance-name>
```

For instance, let's install an instance named **frontend** in our gluestack project:
```sh
$ node glue add web frontend
```

During the installation process, you will be prompted to select a template for your application's **frontend**. You will have three options to choose from: **next-gluestack-ts**, **next-tailwind-ts**, and **next-ts**. Choose the template that best suits your needs and proceed with the installation.

Option will be something like this:

<img src='/assets/frontend.png'/>

After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named after the **frontend** template that you selected during the installation process.

This directory will be located in the root directory of your project and will contain all the necessary files and folders for your application's **frontend**.
