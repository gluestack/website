# How to install

##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin
  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add storage storage
    ```
     The **Storage plugin instance** name should only be **'storage'**.

  <br/>

* Now, after installing the dependency it will ask you for selecting the storage instance and
  graphql instance. Select the instance option with which you want to connect your storage
  plugin.

  Option will be something like this:
    
    <img src='/assets/storageScreenshot.png'/>
    

  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**services**” and inside that **services** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **storage** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the **storage plugin instance** should be something like this:
    
   ```jsx
      📂backend
      ┗ 📂services
          ┗ 📂storage
    ```
