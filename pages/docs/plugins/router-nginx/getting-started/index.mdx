# Getting Started

##

Glue Plugin Router Nginx manages endpoints and routes against all the installed plugin instances
into one nginx.conf file and runs the same nginx.conf into Nginx container.

This plugin works as an API Gateway for your gluestack project.

Though it is essential for each plugin instance to keep a **router.js** file in the following format:

```javascript
module.exports = () => {
  return [
    {
      "server_name": "sub-domain-name"
    },
    {
      "path": "/path/to/instance/(.*)",
      "proxy": {
        "instance": "instance-name:app-port",
        "path": "/app/internal/path/$1"
      },
      size_in_mb: "50"
    }
  ];
};
```

* "router.js" should return Array of Objects
* "**server_name**" key should be a string and should be kept in a separate object, this string serves as global sub-domain for the instance
* All other objects in the same "**router.js**" file are treated as locations, and here's how it works -
  * "**path**" key should be a string and it is location which nginx catches from incoming traffic requests and accepts wildcard patterns as in nginx's configuration
  * "**proxy**" key should be an object and should contain "**instance**" and "**path**" which accepts string as value
  * "**proxy.instance**" key is combination for instance name and the port number and is used to **proxy_pass** all incoming requests
  * "**proxy.path**" key is the path within the instance which would be used to reroute all your requests
  * "**size_in_mb**" key accepts string and value should be the size in MB & is optional, and default is set to 50 mb
