# CLI Reference
---

Glue Plugin Engine is the process manager for your gluestack projects and it manages all the plugins.

## node glue develop:up

This command runs all the installed **plugin instances** in **Docker**. You can use
the below command to run your gluestack project:
```sh
$ node glue develop:up
```

## node glue develop:down

This command stops all the installed **plugin instances** running in **Docker**. You
can use the below command to stop your gluestack project:
```sh
$ node glue develop:down
```

## node glue develop:list

This command lists all the installed **plugin instances** running in **Docker**.

You can use the below command to list your installed plugin instances in your gluestack
project:
```sh
$ node glue develop:list
```

This command comes up with an option to filter the list of plugin instances which
helps in looking up for a specific plugin's instances.
```sh
$ node glue develop:list --filter <your-search-string-goes-here>
```

To obtain information about the **Glue Plugin Postgres** that has been successfully installed in our application under the instance name "postgres," you
can execute the appropriate command:

```sh
$ node glue develop:list --filter postgres
```

## node glue develop:watch

This command runs your gluestack project in **watch** mode. Each plugin's container controller comes with a **watch** method which holds the list of directories
and file paths which are watched for changes.

If changes are made to such directories or files, this command will automatically restart your gluestack project with the latest changes.

The **watch()** function should return an array of strings. Those strings are the **file
path** upon which your application will run on watch mode.

Here's how you can run watch command:
```sh
$ node glue develop:watch
```

## node glue build

This command helps you build plugin's instances. There are two ways to build, one build all plugin instances and other build one plugin instance at a time.

To build all installed plugin instances, you can run the following command:
```sh
$ node glue build
```

To build one plugin instance, you can run the following command:
```sh
$ node glue build <instance-name>
```
