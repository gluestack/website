# How to install

##

<br />

- To install this plugin, you need to bootstrap a project using **Gluestack Framework**,
  behind the scenes this plugin auomatically gets installed and configure itself.

  <br />

  To bootstrap a project using **Gluestack Framework** you need to run a command following
  this pattern.

  ```bash
  $ npx create-gluestack-app <Your-App-Name>

  OR

  $ npm init gluestack-app <Your-App-Name>
  ```

  <br />

- For example, In my case I wanted to create an application using **Gluestack** with my application
  name as **“my-gluestack-app”**, then I will follow this pattern to bootstrap my project:

  <br />

  ```bash
  $ npx create-gluestack-app my-gluestack-app

  OR

  $ npm init gluestack-app my-gluestack-app
  ```

  Here my Application name is **my-gluestack-app**.

  <br />

- Now when the project is created then you don't need to install engine plugin, it
  has been already installed, it comes with **Gluestack Framework**.
