# How to Install

##

<br/>

* To install the Auth plugin, start by opening your local terminal and typing in the following command. 

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue add auth auth
    ```

  <br/>
    
* It's important to note that the instance name should be **auth** and not any other name. 

  <br/>

* After the dependency is installed, you will be prompted to select a **GraphQL** instance from a list of instances that you have previously installed. This is to establish a connection between your **Auth** app and the chosen **GraphQL** instance. Simply select the instance that you want to connect with your **Auth** app and proceed with the installation.

  Option will be something like this:
    
    <img src='/assets/authScreenshot.png'/>
    

  <br/>

* If the installation of the **Auth** plugin is successful, you can verify this by checking the **backend** folder. Inside the **backend** folder, there should be a folder named **services**. Within the **services** folder, you should see a new folder that is named after your **Auth** plugin instance, which in this case is **auth**.

  The overall directory path for the **Auth** plugin instance should look something like this:
      
   ```jsx
      ðŸ“‚backend
      â”— ðŸ“‚services
          â”— ðŸ“‚auth
    ```
