##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue add auth <instance-name>
    ```

  <br/>

* For example, In my case I wanted to install **Auth plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“auth”**, then I will follow this pattern to install auth plugin instance in
  my app:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add auth auth
    ```
    
    Here my instance name is **auth**.

  <br/>

* Now, after installing the dependency it will ask you for selecting an 
  instance which has the option for the list of graphql instances you 
  have installed. Select the one with which you want to connect your auth app.

  Option will be something like this:
    
    <img src='/assets/authScreenshot.png'/>
    

  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**services**” and inside that **services** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **auth** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the **auth plugin instance** should be something like this:
  
  **backend/services/auth**
