# How to Install

##

To install the **Auth** plugin, start by opening your local terminal and typing in the following command.

```sh
$ node glue add auth auth
```

It's important to note that the instance name should be **auth** and not any other name.

After the dependency is installed, you will be prompted to select a **GraphQL** instance from a list of instances that you have previously installed.

This is to establish a connection between your **Auth** app and the chosen **GraphQL** instance. Simply select the instance that you want to connect with your **Auth** app and proceed with the installation.

Option will be something like this:

- If the installation of the **Auth** plugin is successful, you can verify this by checking the **backend** folder.

- Inside the **backend** folder, there should be a folder named **services**.

- Within the **services** folder, you should see a new folder that is named after your **Auth** plugin instance, which in this case is **auth**.

The overall directory path for the **Auth** plugin instance should look something like this:

```jsx
  ðŸ“‚ backend
  â”— ðŸ“‚ services
      â”— ðŸ“‚ auth
```
