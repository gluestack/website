# How to Install

## node glue service:add

To add a micro-service to your gluestack project, you can use the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
$ node glue add service:add
```

During the installation process, you will be prompted to select a service type, such as **service-node**.

Once you have selected your desired service type, you will be prompted to provide an **instance name** for your service.

<img src='/assets/instance-name.png' />

For example, let's say we want to install an instance named **landlord** in our **gluestack** project.

After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named **landlord**, located in the **backend/services** folder of your project. This directory will contain all the necessary files and folders for your service, allowing you to customize it according to your needs.

```jsx
  ðŸ“‚ backend
  â”— ðŸ“‚ services
      â”— ðŸ“‚ landlord
```
