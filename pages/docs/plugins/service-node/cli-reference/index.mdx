# CLI Reference

## node glue function:add

This command will add a function (which is basically a route) to your micro-service with a basic **ExpressJS** handler.

```sh
$ node glue function:add <function-name>
```

## node glue function:attach-action

This command will attach **Hasura GraphQL Action** to your **function** with a basic **ExpressJS** handler.

_Note: In case, you don't have any **GraphQL** instances installed in your gluestack project, then command won't do anything._

```sh
$ node glue function:attach-action
```

After running this command, you will be prompted to select a service type. Choose the **"service-node"** option,
and then select a service instance for adding a GraphQL action.

Next, choose one of the available instance.

Finally, you will be asked to select a function (express route) to add a **GraphQL** action.
