# Getting Started
##

Glue Plugin Backend creates following things post its installation -
- **backend** directory if it does not exists in your gluestack project's root directory
- **backend/crons** directory with **crons.json** file which contains all your project specific CRONs
- **backend/events** directory with **app** and **database** sub-directories all your project specific events
  - **backend/events/app** directory will contain all the app events
  - **backend/events/database** directory will contain all the database events
- **backend/engine** directory contains the **gluestack backend engine server** which manages **Events**, **Crons** & **Queues**

> Note: Please do not make any changes in your **backend/engine** directory's codebase. Changes init might break your Events, Crons & Queue.
