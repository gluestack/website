# How to install

##

<br />

- To install this plugin, open your local terminal and type the following command:

  <br />

  ```bash
  $ node glue add minio <instance-name>
  ```

  <br />

- For example, if you want to install a **Minio plugin instance** with the name **minio**, use the following pattern:

  <br />

  ```bash
  $ node glue add minio minio
  ```

  Here my instance name is **minio**.

<!-- <br />

 - After installing the dependency, it will give you an output in the terminal containing information for interacting with your **Minio** server.

  Output will be something like this:

  <img src="/assets/MinioCredScreenshot.png" />

  <br />
  <br /> -->

- If the plugin is installed successfully, you can see a new **storage** folder created inside the **backend** directory.

  The overall directory path for the **Minio** plugin instance should be something like this:"

   ```jsx
      ðŸ“‚backend
      â”— ðŸ“‚storage
        â”— ðŸ“‚minio
    ```
