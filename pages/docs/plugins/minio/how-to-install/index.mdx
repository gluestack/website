# How to install

##

<br />

- First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin

  <br />

  ```bash
  $ node glue add minio <instance-name>
  ```

  <br />

- For example, In my case I wanted to install **minio plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“minio”**, then I will follow this pattern to install minio plugin instance in
  my app:

  <br />

  ```bash
  $ node glue add minio minio
  ```

  Here my instance name is **minio**.

  <br />

- Now, after installing the dependency it will give you an output on the terminal in which
  information is present in order to interacting with your **minio server**.

  Output will be something like this:

  {" "}

  <br />

- If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** there
  is a new folder named **storage** is created.

  Overall directory path for the **minio plugin instance** should be something like this:

  **backend/storage**
