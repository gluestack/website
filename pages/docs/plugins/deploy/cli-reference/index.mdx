# CLI Reference

## node glue deploy

This command will compress your application and initialises the deployment.

```sh
$ node glue deploy
```

It's important to ensure that your application is properly configured and tested before running the deployment command, to avoid any issues or errors during the deployment process.

## node glue deploy:watch

The **deploy:watch** command is a variant of the deployment command that allows you to monitor the deployment process in real-time.

When you run this command, it will compress your application and initiate the deployment process as usual, but it will also start a watch mode that allows you to view the deployment logs as they are generated.

```sh
$ node glue deploy:watch
```

The watch mode is helpful to debug, identify and resolve issues during the deployment process, as it provides real-time feedback on the progress of the deployment and any errors or warnings that may occur.
