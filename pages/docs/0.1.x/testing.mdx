ðŸ’¡ **Why Test?**

Automated tests help you and your team build complex gluestack applications quickly and confidently by preventing regressions and encouraging you to break apart your application into testable functions, modules, classes, and components. As with any application, your new gluestack app can fail in many ways, and it's essential that you can catch these issues and fix them before releasing them.

This guide will cover basic terminology and provide recommendations on which tools to choose for your gluestack application.
