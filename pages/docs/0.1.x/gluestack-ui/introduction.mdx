# Introduction

**gluestack/ui** is a UI library for React and React Native. It is the ultimate choice for developers who want to build fast, lightweight, and universally accessible applications using React Native and React Native Web. With a single API for all platforms and excellent lighthouse scores, gluestack/ui makes it easy to create top-quality applications that perform well on any device.”

**gluestack/ui** ships with two low-level libraries — **styled** and **creator; styled** is a CSS-in-JS library based on top of React Native Web, while **creator** handles interactions and adds accessibility to the styled-components (Oh! looks like that name has already been taken).

But, if you aren’t looking for low-level utilities, we have packaged a default theme and built a set of components that you can use straightaway from `@gluestack/ui` like Button, Menu, Alert, etc.

## Goals

- Provide a single API for building cross-platform apps using React Native and React Native Web.
- Improve upon the functionality and ease of use of the previous version (NativeBase v3).
- Offer a lightweight and fast library that won't slow down apps.
- Make the library universal, allowing it to be used to build apps for a wide range of platforms.
- Achieve excellent lighthouse scores for performance and accessibility.
