# Architecture

## The three building blocks

- **styled**: A CSS-in-JS library based on React Native Web with minimal runtime overhead
- **creator**: Adds accessibility on top of any styled or React Native component
- **ui**: A suite of styled and accessible components built on top of styled and creator. The gluestack users and gluestack plugin developers can directly use this. It can be ejected and edited by the users to customize.
