# FAQs

You may have many questions as you start exploring gluestack. We have tried to list them here.

## Can I use gluestack only for the front-end or back-end?

Yes.

## Can I split the repo into smaller repos of web, mobile & APIs?

We don’t have this feature as of now. We know that large projects may need this at some point for better access management & security. We will revisit this in our future releases. Git submodules look like a good option.

## Can I use gluestack on production (as of Jan 2023)?

Not yet. We have released an early developer preview and are collecting feedback from the community to improve the product.

## What do I need to know before starting with gluestack?

The current stack of plugins uses Next.js (React), GraphQL, Hasura, SQL and TypeScript. The knowledge of these would help you with a speedy start. But we do have a getting started guide if you’re starting fresh.
