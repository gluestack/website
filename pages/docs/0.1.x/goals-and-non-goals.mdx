# Goals and non-goals

We have two distinct parts of gluestack: the core framework and the plugins. We have different goals for each one of them.

# The core framework

### Goals (the core framework):

- Initialize a project with a CLI
- Provide a local CLI inside every project
- Don’t ship anything functional with the initial bootstrap
- Enable full-stack developers to
  - Install plugins
  - Run the local dev environment
- Enable plugin developers to
  - Initialize, develop & publish plugins
  - Provide them with a persistent store where they can store meta information
- While the plugins are written in TypeScript / JavaScript, the templates of plugins aren’t limited to TypeScript / JavaScript. For eg: We have a plugin for Flutter.

### Non-goals (the core framework):

- The core has no opinion about what the plugin developers build, what language they use and what they add to the user’s project.
- …

## Plugins

A suite of plugins (opinions) to build web & mobile apps with an API backend

### Goals (core plugins):

- Every plugin brings in its own set of opinions.

### Non-goals (core plugins):

-
