# Introduction to gluestack

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ gluestack is **not ready for production** use yet. The current version is an Early Developer Preview.

</aside>

gluestack is an open-source framework for building full-stack web and mobile apps.

It has two parts

While almost everything is built as swapable modules, the core pieces are Next.js, Storybook, TypeScript, GraphQL, Hasura & Dapr for functions. Yes, thatâ€™s some opinions!

As of now, the mobile app module uses React Native. The UI components are shared between Web and Mobile with `@gluestack/ui`. For mobile app, we are considering Flutter as an option for the future versions.

We have Smart Contracts, Native platforms, etc. under consideration.

## Is it a CLI? A framework? A dev environment?

Yes, itâ€™s all three. You can use the CLI to initialize the project, run the dev environment, add plugins like Web, API or Storybook.

We have an optional plugin that makes it easy to deploy any gluestack app to the Seal platform. Seal is a hosting service optimized and built for gluestack apps by the creators of gluestack.

# What gluestack is not?

# Core beliefs

This project has a specific set of principles that guide our decision-making. These principles form the foundation of our approach to building.

### Innovate Carefully

We love using cutting-edge technologies. They can bring a lot of speed and excitement to a project. However, we believe in being strategic about where we use these riskier technologies. This means we might be hesitant to use untested database tech (PostgreSQL is great), but we're happy to experiment with GraphQL & TypeScript generations because it's easy to switch out if necessary.

### No compromise with the Performance

â€¦

### Developer Experience

â€¦

### Architecture first, language indepedent

â€¦

We have two parts of the gluestack framework, the first part gives us the platform on top of which we build apps.

## Part 1: The core

The core has the following principles.

- Architecture first, **l**anguage indepedent
- Bring what you want
- Loosly coupled

The core provides the bare-bones to initialize a gluestack project, and an environment to use and build plugins. The first decision that we made was to use NPM as the package manager that let us initialize projects and plugins. The second decision was to use Dockers to provide the dev environment and boot the depedent services.

Note: This doesnâ€™t mean that the core enforces to use JavaScript / TypeScript to build a gluestack app. The part 2 does that.

## Part 2: The opinions

Most of the opinions that were formed comes from our experience of running an app development agency and building hundreds of web and mobile apps.

It's easy to fall into the habit of adding everything under the sun, but that's not our goal. Any additions to the create-gluestack-app project should address a specific issue within the core technologies included.

[Rephrase the following]

For example, we won't add state libraries (like zustand or redux), but we will add something like NextAuth.js and integrate Hasura and GraphQL for you.

[ Include Standarization, Proven technology, â€¦ ]

These opinions

- Solve for most but not for all
- Adopt the best
- Comes with no lock-in
