# Other Recommendation

While we are working on adding more plugins that work with the web so that itâ€™s easy for gluestack developers to add features like Authentication, Authorization, auto-generation of GraphQL hooks by Apollo.

You can use the following recommendations.

- Authentication: [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Forms: [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- API calls: Apollo hooks with generator
- State management: Open for now
