# Installation

You can install the web plugin by running the following command.

```jsx
> node glue add web <web-project-name>
```

The current version of the web plugin uses the latest version of Next.js with @glustack/ui. This copies the default template into your root folder under `<web-project-name>`.

You can create multiple web projects in the same gluestack project. An example is when you want to boot separate web projects for the website, userâ€™s app and a super admin.

## Running the local dev server

You can run a web instance by running the following command. You can provide the name of the folder that you want to boot.

```bash
> node glue develop:up <web-project-name>
```

You can also check the running processes and containers at any time using.

```bash
> node glue develop:list
```

Usually the develop:up command puts up the web project at this URL `[http://](http://localhost:9100)[localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100/)`. Now, you can start building your web app by making changes to `pages/index.tsx`.
